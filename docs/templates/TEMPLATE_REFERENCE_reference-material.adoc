// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: my-reference-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='my-reference-a']
// * Title: = My reference A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='reference-material_{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Reference material
//In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find information quickly.

This paragraph is the reference module introduction and is only optional. Include it to provide a short overview of the module.

A reference module provide data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember. It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table. A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want. AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

.Unordered lists
* For more details on writing reference modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
