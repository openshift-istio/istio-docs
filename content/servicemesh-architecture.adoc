{Productname} is composed of these following components:

////
Data Plane :
Envoy Proxy : a network services proxy that mediates all inbound and outbound traffic for each services in the service mesh.
Control Plane :
Istio-Pilot - service discovery, registration and load balancing
Istio-Auth - strong service-to-service and end-user authentication using mutual TLS
Istio-Mixer - responsible for enforcing access control across the service mesh & collecting telemetry data from the Envoy proxy and other services.
////

* *Envoy* - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic between services in the cluster and from a service to external services. The proxies form a secure microservice mesh providing a rich set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers, policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting functions.

NOTE: The service mesh is not an overlay network. It simplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to each other over the network provided by the underlying platform.

* *Mixer* - Central component that is leveraged by the proxies and microservices to enforce policies such as authorization, rate limits, quotas, authentication, request tracing and telemetry collection.

* *Pilot* - A component responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.

* *Citadel* - A centralized component responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.

* *Node Agent* - A per-node component responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.

* *Broker* - A component implementing the Open Service Broker API for {Productname}-based services. (Under development)
