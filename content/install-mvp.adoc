= Installing OpenShift Service Mesh

In order to make it as easy as possible to preview OpenShift Service Mesh, based the Istio project, we've created a special version of the `oc` command line tool for OpenShift. When you run `oc cluster up`, that single command performs the following actions:

* Creates the openshift-ansible-istio-job which runs the Ansible playbook that performs the installation.
* Starts a single-node local OpenShift cluster.
* Provisions Istio and Jaeger components on OpenShift.
* Configures automatic sidecar injection for the Istio proxy.
* Provisions a customized Fabric8 Launcher that makes example applications (boosters) available for use on OpenShift.

== Getting Started

. You can https://github.com/openshift-istio/origin/releases[download the istiooc client tool created specifically for this release from GitHub] and rename it to `oc`.

. Follow the https://github.com/openshift-istio/istio-docs/blob/master/content/user-journey.adoc[installation instructions] to install Istio, the Fabric8 Launcher, and the Jaeger components.

. Select a sample application (booster) and follow the README documentation for the tutorial (mission) for that Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtime.

TODO - Update with links to the other available missions.

Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtime missions:

* https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-istio-circuit-breaker-booster/blob/master/README.adoc[*Istio Circuit Breaker mission*] - This scenario showcases how Istio can be used to implement the Circuit Breaker architectural pattern.

* https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-istio-distributed-tracing-booster/blob/master/README.adoc[*Istio Distributed Tracing mission*] - This scenario showcases the interaction of Distributed Tracing capabilities of Jaeger and properly instrumented microservices running in the Service Mesh.

* https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-istio-security-booster/blob/master/README.adoc[*Security mission*] -This scenario showcases Istio security concepts whereby access to services is controlled by the platform rather than independently by constituent applications.

* https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-istio-routing-booster/blob/master/README.adoc[*Routing mission*] - This scenario showcases using Istioâ€™s dynamic traffic routing capabilities with a set of example applications designed to simulate a real-world rollout scenarios scenario.
