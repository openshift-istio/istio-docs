= {Productname} Overview

{Productname} is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. 

The term *_service mesh_* is often used to describe the network of microservices that make up applications based on a distributed microservice architecture, and the interactions between those microservices.  As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage. {Productname} provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole. 

{Productname} gives you a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies, and aggregate telemetry data.


////
A multi-vendor initiative to establish a uniform way to connect, manage, monitor and secure services :

Connect: Resiliency, discovery, load balancing
Manage: Traffic control, policy enforcement
Monitor: Metrics, Logging, Tracing
Secure: End-to-end Authentication and Authorization

Problem Area

Creating and maintaining production-grade distributed systems (microservices) is hard. 

Designers of microservices applications must account for service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, monitoring, dynamic routing, compliance, security. And must do all of that consistently for any language and runtime.

Current attempts to solve these big issues have been language or runtime specific, require application specific changes and require multiple technology solutions to be integrated together.

Benefits of Istio

Codifies common service interaction and service design patterns for building secure, resilient applications 
Programing language and runtime agnostic - not dependent on a particular language of framework 
Unintrusive - existing applications and services can make use of many of the Istio capabilities without change to application code.
Focus on policy and not code
Pre-integrated Service-mesh architecture based on mature design patterns and technologies
