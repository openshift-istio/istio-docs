= Notes for GA

== Short Name

OSSM vs RH-OSSM

== Registry URL

For technology preview - registry.access.redhat.com - OK with referencing the unautheticated registry because we want the feedback.

For GA - registry.redhat.io - want to transition customers over to the new (authenticated) registry

== Upgrade Path

Will shift to operators.  Upgrade may be rip it out and re-install?  or we may have a migration path.
